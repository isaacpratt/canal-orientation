# canal-orientation
Measure the orientation of vascular canals in cortical bone

This project was created by Isaac Pratt based on an initial macro created by Dr. David Cooper and used in (Britz et al, 2012). This project updates that macro to measure the 3D orientation of canals in cortical bone. For full details on how it works see (Pratt & Cooper, 2017) and (Pratt et al, 2018).

This repository contains the following files:

1) The macro itself - Measure 3D orientation-v1.3.5.txt

The macro is written using the imageJ script language and can be run in imageJ or in FIJI. The macro is tested and working in imageJ version 1.49u

The macro functions on lineset files produced in Amira, and can be used to subsample lineset files directly. Alternatively, if large lineset files are produced, the python subsampler below can be used.
